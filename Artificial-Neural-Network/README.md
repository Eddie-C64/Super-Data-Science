# Simple-Artificial-Neural-Network
In this project I use keras to build a quick and simple artificial neural network.
# Dependencies
One the terminal type pip install requirements.txt. This will install the packages in order to run the notebook.
# Data
The churn_modelling.csv is bank data about customers who have left the bank. I used select features to predict if the customers will likely leave the bank with percentage of likely hood of leaving.
